##### Build Better

Black Sphere Studios about building better tools for a better tomorrow. We work smarter, not harder. We build better, not faster. We are in the business of fixing things and building a better future for everyone.

True progress can only be made by honest efforts, and to that end, we seek to rightfully earn the trust of our customers through consistent quality, excellent customer service, and no excuses. When we sell you a product, we are selling a promise. A promise that we will never ruin it, run it into the ground, or sell it to the highest bidder. Professional software shouldn't fall over if you look at it funny. Customers are willing to pay for a reliable, ad-free experience.

##### A Future For All Of Us

We are dedicated to building a positive, respectful, inclusive community. We support free speech, not hate speech, and strive to maintain an inviting atmosphere everywhere we can. Our goal is to bring humanity's future to **everyone**, not just the lucky few.

Join us on this incredible journey, and together, we can do more than build a better company. We can build a better world.
