      <title>FeatherGUI v0.1 Released</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Black-Sphere-Studios/feathergui/releases/tag/v0.1.0&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FeatherGUI v0.1.0 developer preview&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has been released, and is now available for testing! As the first public release of FeatherGUI, this is an &lt;strong&gt;alpha&lt;/strong&gt; release, which is not considered stable and should not be used in production. Known bugs are &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Black-Sphere-Studios/feathergui/issues&#34;&gt;tracked on Github&lt;/a&gt;, but please report any new bugs by &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Black-Sphere-Studios/feathergui/issues/new&#34;&gt;filling a Github Issue&lt;/a&gt;. Join the &lt;a href=&#34;https://discord.gg/nFczp8J&#34;&gt;official discord server&lt;/a&gt; to discuss issues with the developer and talk to other users of FeatherGUI!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SDK contains precompiled binaries, debug symbols, media files, and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Black-Sphere-Studios/bss-util/releases/tag/v0.5.0&#34;&gt;bss-util v0.5.0&lt;/a&gt; include files that aren&amp;rsquo;t included in the source tree to make compilation easier. Note, however, that compiling fgDirect2D and fgDotNet requires a compatible version of the Windows SDK installed and configured on your machine. If Visual Studio complains it can&amp;rsquo;t find the SDK, you can try to change the target SDK version to the one you have - any version will do, so long as it supports Direct2D v1.1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A layout editor is included in this SDK. While it is functional, there are a number of &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Black-Sphere-Studios/feathergui/issues/33&#34;&gt;bugs and missing features&lt;/a&gt; due to this being an early alpha release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A POSIX pre-compiled SDK is also provided, but there are currently no POSIX-compatible backends, so while both FeatherGUI and fgExample-c compile in POSIX environments, they are useless without a backend to support them (the example will segfault without a backend).&lt;/p&gt;
